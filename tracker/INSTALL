Kahn Tracker v0.1
-----------------

If you would like to run your own Kahn tracker for your own private
Kahn network, just follow these instructions.

1. Install MySQL from www.mysql.com
2. Create a database in MySQL for the tracker data.  I recommend using
   the name "ktrack":
     $ mysqladmin create ktrack

3. Create the server table by running the following command:
     $ mysql ktrack < kahntracker.mysql
   
   ** You may have to enter a username and password on this line:
     $ mysql -uusername -ppassword ktrack < kahntracker.mysql

4. Edit the lines for $host, $db, $dbuser and $dbpass to correspond to
   your database host, name, user and password.

5. Start your tracker!
     $ ./kahntracker.pl

   It will launch into the background.

6. (Optional) Setup the provided cron job to make sure the tracker stays
   running:

   Edit trackerchk and kahntracker.cron and change the /path/to/ lines to
   point to where you have installed the tracker.

   Then install the cron file:
     $ crontab kahntracker.cron

   ** If you have an existing crontab file, append the line from 
      kahntracker.cron to it

Let me know if there are any problems with these instructions.
